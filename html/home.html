        <h2>Why study at Spring Flowers School?</h2>
        <ul id=custom-list>
          <li>Professors and lecturers aren’t just teachers – they’re mentors too. For students to see and understand the paths their professors have been on to get where they are today can be both inspiring and valuable.</li>
          <li>It’s important to encourage students to learn from their mistakes and view them as an opportunity to improve. A lot of the time, setbacks and ‘failure’ can be the catalyst for future success as lessons are learnt.</li>
          <li>While students are equipped with the tools and theories necessary to deal with and overcome the challenges of everyday life, they’re also encouraged to identify their strengths and characteristics and how they can best use them.</li>
          <li>Providing hands-on learning opportunities and getting students out into the real world to achieve greatness.</li>
          <li>Teaching and learning should always be relevant – whether it’s related to your course or extra-curricular activities. While Spring Flowers School teaches its students necessary workplace skills, it also teaches them about the importance of wellbeing, and proposes positive practices, including how to manage emotions, how to engage in the communities, how to have positive relations with others and most critically, how to have meaning in life.</li>

          <blockquote>The Spring Flowers School played an integral part in making me the person that I am today. The combination of caring staff, dedicated faculty, and inspiring peers from all over the world showed me how to think with an open mind, and apply that understanding of diversity to everything I do. The values and skills that I was taught here through the IB program made me feel more confident in myself, especially when it came to pursuing my higher education abroad. Looking back, I am proud to say that I am an alumnus of SFS.</blockquote>

        <div class="testimonial">
          <blockquote>Personally, I felt that the best part about Spring Flowers School was its diversity. While I did not realize it initially, the diverse environment created by the people who come from various backgrounds has taught me a lot. It taught me about other cultures and helped me learn more about all the various people who live in our world. Such knowledge is incredibly beneficial in a more globalized world and personally it has helped me overcome cultural barriers outside school.</blockquote>
